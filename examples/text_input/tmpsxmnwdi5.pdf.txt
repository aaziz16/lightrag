INSTALLATION RECOMMENDATIONS
General
. Install gypsum board in accordance with methods described in
ASTM C840 and GA-216.
· Examine and inspect framing materials to which gypsum board
is to be applied. Remedy all defects prior to installation of the
gypsum board.
. Use GridMarX to make accurate cuts without drawing lines.
GridMarX guide marks run the length of the board at five points, in
4 in. (102 mm) increments. Marks run along the edge in both tapers
and at 16 in. (406 mm), 24 in. (610 mm) and 32 in. (813 mm) in the
field of the board. GridMarX also provides quick identification and
uniform nail/screw patterns. The marks cover easily with no
bleed-through using standard paint products.
· Apply gypsum board first to ceilings at right angles to framing
members, then to walls. Use boards of maximum practical length
so that the minimum number of end joints occur. Bring board edges
into contact with each other but do not force into place.
· Install batt or blanket ceiling insulation before the gypsum board on
ceilings when installing a vapor retarder behind the gypsum board.
Install the insulation immediately after the gypsum board when
using loose fill insulation. Avoid installation practices that might
allow condensation to form behind boards.
· Cut gypsum board to allow for a minimum 1/4 in. (6.4 mm) gap
between gypsum board and floor to prevent potential wicking
of moisture.
· Provide minimum 1/4 in. (6.4 mm) clearance between boards and
adjacent concrete or masonry to minimize wicking of moisture.

· Locate gypsum board joints at openings so that no joint will occur
within 12 in. (305 mm) of the edges of the opening unless installing
control joints at these points. Stagger vertical end joints. Joints on
opposite sides of a partition should not occur on the same stud.
. Hold gypsum board in firm contact with the framing member while
driving fasteners. Fastening should proceed from center portion
of the board toward the edges and ends. Set fasteners with heads
slightly below the surface of the board. Take care to avoid breaking
the face paper of the gypsum board. Remove improperly driven
nails or screws.
· Maintain a room temperature of not less than 40°F (4℃) during
application of gypsum board.
. Maintain a room temperature of not less than 50°F (10℃) when
using adhesive to attach gypsum board and during joint treatment,
texturing and decoration, beginning 48 hours prior to application
and continuously thereafter until completely dry. Maintain adequate
ventilation in the working area during installation and curing period.
. Double nailing is an alternate method of attachment devised to
minimize nailpops. This system requires doubling up on the field
nails. The total quantity of nails used does not double, however,
since maximum nail spacing is increased to 12 in. (305 mm) o.c.
and conventional nailing is used on the perimeter. Application is
accomplished by first single nailing the field of the board, starting
at the center and working toward ends and edges. Another nail is
then driven in close proximity (2 in. [50.8 mm] to 2-1/2 in. [63.5 mm])
to each of the first nails. The first series of nails are then struck
again to ensure the board is drawn tightly to the framing member.
· When using adhesive to attach gypsum board, apply drywall
adhesive to face of studs or joists in continuous beads. Reference
ASTM C840 Section 10.
Mold and Mildew Resistance
Hi-Impact XP Gypsum Board was designed to provide extra protection
against mold and mildew compared to standard gypsum board
products. When tested by an independent laboratory, XP Hi-Impact
Gypsum Board received the highest possible ratings on ASTM G21
and ASTM D3273.
No material can be considered "mold proof," nor is it certain that
any material will resist mold or mildew indefinitely. When used in
conjunction with good design, handling and construction practices,
XP Hi-Impact Gypsum Board can provide increased mold resistance
versus standard gypsum board products. As with any building
material, avoiding water exposure during handling, storage and
installation, and after installation is complete, is the best way to avoid
the formation of mold or mildew.
Accessories
Drywall screws, joint tape, ready mix joint compound and setting
compounds.
Fire Resistance Ratings
Fire Resistance ratings represent the results of tests on assemblies
made up of specific materials in a specific configuration. When
selecting construction designs to meet certain fire-resistance
requirements, caution must be used to ensure that each component
of the assembly is the one specified in the test. Further, precautions
should be taken that assembly procedures are in accordance with those
of the tested assembly. For copies of specific tests, call 1-800-NATIONAL.
Finishing
Refer to GA-214, Recommended Levels of Finish for Gypsum Board,
Glass Mat and Fiber-Reinforced Gypsum Panels, to determine the level
of finishing needed to assure a surface properly prepared to accept
the desired decoration.
Decoration
Ensure gypsum board surfaces, including finished joints, are clean,
dust-free and gloss-free to achieve best painting results. Apply a coat
of a quality drywall primer to equalize the porosities between surface
paper and joint compound, improving fastener and joint concealment.
Selection of a paint to provide desired finish characteristics is the
responsibility of the architect or contractor.
Prepare and prime gypsum boards prior to texturing.
Refer to GA-214 to determine the level of finishing needed to assure a
surface properly prepared to accept the desired decoration.
Critical Lighting Areas
Ceiling areas abutting skylights, long hallways, and atriums with
large surface areas washed with artificial or natural lighting are
a few examples of critical lighting areas. Strong side lighting from
windows or surface-mounted light fixtures may reveal minor surface
imperfections. Light striking the surface obliquely, at a slight angle,
exaggerates surface irregularities. If you cannot avoid critical lighting,
minimize the effects by skim coating the ceiling board surfaces, by
decorating the surface with medium to heavy textures, or by the use
of draperies and blinds, which soften shadows. In general, paints
with sheen levels other than flat, enamel paints and dark-toned paint
finishes highlight surface defects; consider using textures to hide
these minor visual imperfections. If necessary, finish boards to a
Level 5 finish, as outlined in GA-214.

gypsum board assemblies. Provide control joints spaced not more
than 30 ft. (9,144 mm) where employing long continuous runs of
walls, partitions or ceilings without perimeter relief.
· Avoid gypsum board joints within 12 in. (305 mm) of the corners
of window or door frames unless installing control joints at these
locations.
· In single-ply installation, all ends and edges of gypsum board should
occur over framing members or other solid backing except where
treated joints occur at right angles to framing or furring members.
· Do not use boards as a nailing base.
· Avoid using in areas subject to constant and/or excessive moisture
and high humidity, such as gang showers, saunas, steam rooms or
swimming pool enclosures.
. Avoid using as a backer board directly behind tile in tub and
shower areas.
· Do not install or treat joints until the building is properly enclosed.

Description
ToughRock® Fireguard X™ and ToughRock® Fireguard CR Gypsum Board
have noncombustible (per ASTM E136 or CAN/ULC S114), dimensionally stable
gypsum cores. The core has been reinforced with the addition of glass fibers,
increasing its strength and its resistance to the passage of heat. The surfacings
on both faces and on the long edges are 100% recycled paper. The front face
paper is white; the back face paper is gray. The ends are square cut.
Georgia-Pacific ToughRock Gypsum Board products are GREENGUARD and
GREENGUARD Gold Certified for low emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs). They are listed in CHPS® High Performance Product Database as low
emitting products.
Primary Uses
ToughRock Fireguard X and Fireguard C Gypsum Board are wall or ceiling covering
materials for use in building construction. Both are designed for direct mechanical
attachment to wood or metal framing for use in building assemblies with a
designated fire resistance rating.
A specially formulated gypsum core which includes glass fibers enables ToughRock
Fireguard X and Fireguard C Gypsum Board to help protect framing members from
the spread of fire. With joints covered, ToughRock Fireguard X and Fireguard C Gypsum
Board will resist the passage of smoke.
ToughRock Fireguard X and Fireguard C Gypsum Board are manufactured with a
paper surfacing designed to be receptive to joint treatment, paint, wall covering,
or textured coatings.

locations where sound leaks may develop.
Application Standards
ToughRock Fireguard X and Fireguard C Gypsum Board may be applied according
to the Gypsum Association Publication GA-216 or ASTM C840 for non-fire rated
construction.
For fire resistance rated construction application regarding board orientation,
fastener type and spacing shall be consistent with the tested construction details
for Type X Gypsum Board. These details are published in the Gypsum Association
"Fire Resistance Design Manual GA-600," "UL Fire Resistance Directory," and
"Intertek Testing Services/Warnock Hersey Listings Directory."
Handling Precautions
Stack gypsum board flat on a level surface. As individual sheets are removed for
installation, they should be raised up on edge carefully and carried in a vertical
position. Appropriate handling is also outlined in Gypsum Association Publications
GA-216 and GA-801.
Take care to avoid impact, undue flexing, and subsequent damage to board edges,
ends, and corners. Avoid scuffing the face to be finished.
Handling and Use-Caution
This product may contain fiberglass which may cause skin irritation. Dust and
fibers produced during the handling and installation of the product may cause skin,

Board Decoration-Application Standards
ToughRock® Fireguard X™ and Fireguard C® Gypsum Board are designed to accept
most types of paints, texture and wall covering materials. Georgia-Pacific Gypsum
strongly recommends priming the surface with a full-bodied, quality latex primer
before applying a final decorative material. Priming will equalize the suction
variation between the joint compounds and the paper surface. If glossy paints are
used in such areas as kitchens or bathrooms, skim coat joint compound over the
entire surface to reduce highlighting or joint photographing. This method is also
recommended in areas with severe natural or artificial side lighting.
Georgia-Pacific Gypsum recommends application of a sealer prior to applying
wallpaper or other wall covering to the board so that the board surface will not
be damaged if the covering is subsequently removed during redecorating. Joint
treatment must be thoroughly dry before proceeding with primer application and
final decoration. Refer to Gypsum Association Publications GA-214 and GA-216
for joint treatment and finishing recommendations.
