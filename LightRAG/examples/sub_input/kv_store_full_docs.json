Install gypsum board in accordance with methods described in\nASTM C840 and GA-216.\nÂ· Examine and inspect framing materials to which gypsum board\nis to be applied. Remedy all defects prior to installation of the\ngypsum board.\n. Use GridMarX to make accurate cuts without drawing lines.\nGridMarX guide marks run the length of the board at five points, in\n4 in. (102 mm) increments. Marks run along the edge in both tapers\nand at 16 in. (406 mm), 24 in. (610 mm) and 32 in. (813 mm) in the\nfield of the board. GridMarX also provides quick identification and\nuniform nail/screw patterns. The marks cover easily with no\nbleed-through using standard paint products.\nÂ· Apply gypsum board first to ceilings at right angles to framing\nmembers, then to walls. Use boards of maximum practical length\nso that the minimum number of end joints occur. Bring board edges\ninto contact with each other but do not force into place.\nÂ· Install batt or blanket ceiling insulation before the gypsum board on\nceilings when installing a vapor retarder behind the gypsum board.\nInstall the insulation immediately after the gypsum board when\nusing loose fill insulation. Avoid installation practices that might\nallow condensation to form behind boards.\nÂ· Cut gypsum board to allow for a minimum 1/4 in. (6.4 mm) gap\nbetween gypsum board and floor to prevent potential wicking\nof moisture.\nÂ· Provide minimum 1/4 in. (6.4 mm) clearance between boards and\nadjacent concrete or masonry to minimize wicking of moisture.\n(Continued on page 3)\nDate\nSubmittal Approvals: (Stamps or Signatures)\nXP\nHI-IMPACTÂ®\n---- Page 3 ----\nGold BondÂ® XPÂ® Hi-ImpactÂ® Gypsum Board\nTECHNICAL DATA\nPhysical Properties\nXP Hi-Impact\nThickness1, Nominal\n5/8\" (15.9 mm)\nWidth1, Nominal\n4' (1,219 mm)\nLength1.4, Standard\n8' - 12' (2,438 mm - 3,658 mm)\nWeight, Nominal\n2.8 lbs./sq. ft.(13.67 k/m2)\nEdges1\nTapered\nFlexural Strength1, Perpendicular\nâ‰¥ 147 lbf.

(305 mm) of the edges of the opening unless installing\ncontrol joints at these points. Stagger vertical end joints. Joints on\nopposite sides of a partition should not occur on the same stud.\n. Hold gypsum board in firm contact with the framing member while\ndriving fasteners. Fastening should proceed from center portion\nof the board toward the edges and ends. Set fasteners with heads\nslightly below the surface of the board. Take care to avoid breaking\nthe face paper of the gypsum board. Remove improperly driven\nnails or screws.\nÂ· Maintain a room temperature of not less than 40Â°F (4â„ƒ) during\napplication of gypsum board.\n. Maintain a room temperature of not less than 50Â°F (10â„ƒ) when\nusing adhesive to attach gypsum board and during joint treatment,\ntexturing and decoration, beginning 48 hours prior to application\nand continuously thereafter until completely dry. Maintain adequate\nventilation in the working area during installation and curing period.\n. Double nailing is an alternate method of attachment devised to\nminimize nailpops. This system requires doubling up on the field\nnails. The total quantity of nails used does not double, however,\nsince maximum nail spacing is increased to 12 in. (305 mm) o.c.\nand conventional nailing is used on the perimeter. Application is\naccomplished by first single nailing the field of the board, starting\nat the center and working toward ends and edges. Another nail is\nthen driven in close proximity (2 in. [50.8 mm] to 2-1/2 in. [63.5 mm])\nto each of the first nails. The first series of nails are then struck\nagain to ensure the board is drawn tightly to the framing member.\nÂ· When using adhesive to attach gypsum board, apply drywall\nadhesive to face of studs or joists in continuous beads. Reference\nASTM C840 Section 10.\nMold and Mildew Resistance\nHi-Impact XP Gypsum Board was designed to provide extra protection\nagainst mold and mildew compared to standard gypsum board\nproducts. When tested by an independent laboratory, XP Hi-Impact\nGypsum Board received the highest possible ratings on ASTM G21\nand ASTM D3273.\nNo material can be considered \"mold proof,\" nor is it certain that\nany material will resist mold or mildew indefinitely. When used in\nconjunction with good design, handling and construction practices,\nXP Hi-Impact Gypsum Board can provide increased mold resistance\nversus standard gypsum board products. As with any building\nmaterial, avoiding water exposure during handling, storage and\ninstallation, and after installation is complete, is the best way to avoid\nthe formation of mold or mildew.\nAccessories\nDrywall screws, joint tape, ready mix joint compound and setting\ncompounds.\nFire Resistance Ratings\nFire Resistance ratings represent the results of tests on assemblies\nmade up of specific materials in a specific configuration. When\nselecting construction designs to meet certain fire-resistance\nrequirements, caution must be used to ensure that each component\nof the assembly is the one specified in the test. Further, precautions\nshould be taken that assembly procedures are in accordance with those\nof the tested assembly. For copies of specific tests, call 1-800-NATIONAL.\nFinishing\nRefer to GA-214, Recommended Levels of Finish for Gypsum Board,\nGlass Mat and Fiber-Reinforced Gypsum Panels, to determine the level\nof finishing needed to assure a surface properly prepared to accept\nthe desired decoration.\nDecoration\nEnsure gypsum board surfaces, including finished joints, are clean,\ndust-free and gloss-free to achieve best painting results. Apply a coat\nof a quality drywall primer to equalize the porosities between surface\npaper and joint compound, improving fastener and joint concealment.\nSelection of a paint to provide desired finish characteristics is the\nresponsibility of the architect or contractor.\nPrepare and prime gypsum boards prior to texturing.\nRefer to GA-214 to determine the level of finishing needed to assure a\nsurface properly prepared to accept the desired decoration.\nCritical Lighting Areas\nCeiling areas abutting skylights, long hallways, and atriums with\nlarge surface areas washed with artificial or natural lighting are\na few examples of critical lighting areas. Strong side lighting from\nwindows or surface-mounted light fixtures may reveal minor surface\nimperfections. Light striking the surface obliquely, at a slight angle,\nexaggerates surface irregularities. If you cannot avoid critical lighting,\nminimize the effects by skim coating the ceiling board surfaces, by\ndecorating the surface with medium to heavy textures, or by the use\nof draperies and blinds, which soften shadows. In general, paints\nwith sheen levels other than flat, enamel paints and dark-toned paint\nfinishes highlight surface defects; consider using textures to hide\nthese minor visual imperfections. If necessary, finish boards to a\nLevel 5 finish, as outlined in GA-214.\nXP\nHI-IMPACTÂ®\n3\n---- Page 5 ----\nGold BondÂ® XPÂ® Hi-ImpactÂ® Gypsum Board\nLIMITATIONS\nÂ· To maximize impact resistance and eliminate potential screw spin-\nout, a minimum 20-gauge (.0312 in. design thickness) steel stud is\nrequired, as outlined in GA-216.\nÂ· Avoid exposure to excessive or continuous moisture and extreme\ntemperatures. Do not expose gypsum board to temperatures\nexceeding 125ÂºF (52â„ƒ) for extended periods of time.\nÂ· Properly ventilate or condition attic spaces to remove moisture\nbuildup above gypsum board ceilings. If required, install a vapor\nretarder in exterior ceilings behind gypsum board.\n. Avoid installing gypsum board directly over insulation blankets with\nfacer flanges placed continuously across the face of the framing\nmembers; recess insulation blankets and attach flanges to the\nsides of framing.\nÂ· Isolate gypsum board from contact with building structure in\nlocations where structural movement may impose direct loads on\ngypsum board assemblies. Provide control joints spaced not more\nthan 30 ft. (9,144 mm) where employing long continuous runs of\nwalls, partitions or ceilings without perimeter relief.\nÂ· Avoid gypsum board joints within 12 in. (305 mm) of the corners\nof window or door frames unless installing control joints at these\nlocations.\nÂ· In single-ply installation, all ends and edges of gypsum board should\noccur over framing members or other solid backing except where\ntreated joints occur at right angles to framing or furring members.\nÂ· Do not use boards as a nailing base.\nÂ· Avoid using in areas subject to constant and/or excessive moisture\nand high humidity, such as gang showers, saunas, steam rooms or\nswimming pool enclosures.\n. Avoid using as a backer board directly behind tile in tub and\nshower areas.\nÂ· Do not install or treat joints until the building is properly enclosed.\nNational\nGypsum\nÂ®\nNational Gypsum Company is the exclusive service provider for products\nmanufactured by Gold Bond Building Products, LLC.\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\nArchitectural Specifications\nUL\nGold Bond Building Products CSI MasterFormatÂ® 3-part\nguide specifications are downloadable as editable\nMicrosoftÂ® Word documents at: goldbondbuilding.com.\nGREENGUARD\nPRODUCT CERTIFIED FOR\nLOW CHEMICAL EMISSIONS\nUL.COM/GG\nUL 2818\nGOLD\nLatest Technical Information and Update\nVisit goldbondbuilding.com or call National Gypsum Company\nConstruction Services: 1-800-NATIONAL (628-4662).\nTechnical Information InformaciÃ³n TÃ©cnica\n1-800-NATIONAL\n1-800-628-4662\nNational Gypsum Company is the exclusive service provider for\nproducts manufactured by Gold Bond Building Products, LLC.\nThe Gold Bond family of products is manufactured by\nGold Bond Building Products, LLC.\nÂ®\nGold Bond\nBuilding Products\nGold Bond Building Products, LLC\n2001 Rexford Road\nCharlotte, NC 28211\n704.365.7300\ngoldbondbuilding.com\n4\n110973 REV. 01 21\n---- Page 6 ----\nGYP BD-6\nGold Bond\nFire-ShieldÂ® Gypsum Board\nDESCRIPTION\nGold BondÂ® Fire-ShieldÂ® Gypsum Board consists of a fire-resistant\ngypsum core with a heavy, natural finish and 100-percent recycled\npaper on the face and back sides.

Georgia-Pacific Gypsum\nstrongly recommends priming the surface with a full-bodied, quality latex primer\nbefore applying a final decorative material. Priming will equalize the suction\nvariation between the joint compounds and the paper surface. If glossy paints are\nused in such areas as kitchens or bathrooms, skim coat joint compound over the\nentire surface to reduce highlighting or joint photographing. This method is also\nrecommended in areas with severe natural or artificial side lighting.\nGeorgia-Pacific Gypsum recommends application of a sealer prior to applying\nwallpaper or other wall covering to the board so that the board surface will not\nbe damaged if the covering is subsequently removed during redecorating. Joint\ntreatment must be thoroughly dry before proceeding with primer application and\nfinal decoration. Refer to Gypsum Association Publications GA-214 and GA-216\nfor joint treatment and finishing recommendations.\nPhysical Properties\nProperties\nToughRockÂ® Fireguard Xâ„¢\nThickness, nominal inches\n5/8\" (15.9 mm), + 1/64\" (0.4 mm)\nWidth, nominal\n4' (1220 mm), 54\" (1372 mm),\n60\" (1524 mm) + 3/32\" (2.4 mm)\nLength, Standard\n8' (2440 mm) to 14' (4270 mm),\n+ 1/4\" (6.4 mm)\nWeight1, Ibs./sq. ft., nominal (kg/m2)\n2.2 (10.7)\nEdges\nTapered, square or\ntapered with rounded edges\nFlexural Strength2 spacing, min.\nâ‰¥46 (205)\nâ‰¥46 (205)\nâ‰¥36 (160)\nâ‰¥107 (476)\nParallel, Ibf.
