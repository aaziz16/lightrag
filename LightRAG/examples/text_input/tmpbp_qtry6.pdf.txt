Board Decoration-Application Standards
ToughRock® Fireguard X™ and Fireguard C® Gypsum Board are designed to accept
most types of paints, texture and wall covering materials. Georgia-Pacific Gypsum
strongly recommends priming the surface with a full-bodied, quality latex primer
before applying a final decorative material. Priming will equalize the suction
variation between the joint compounds and the paper surface. If glossy paints are
used in such areas as kitchens or bathrooms, skim coat joint compound over the
entire surface to reduce highlighting or joint photographing. This method is also
recommended in areas with severe natural or artificial side lighting.
Georgia-Pacific Gypsum recommends application of a sealer prior to applying
wallpaper or other wall covering to the board so that the board surface will not
be damaged if the covering is subsequently removed during redecorating. Joint
treatment must be thoroughly dry before proceeding with primer application and
final decoration. Refer to Gypsum Association Publications GA-214 and GA-216
for joint treatment and finishing recommendations.

Installation
Recommendations
Installation of CertainTeed Type X
Gypsum Boards should be consistent
with methods described in the standards
and references noted. Cutting should be
from the face side of the boards for best
results.
Decoration
CertainTeed Type X Gypsum Board
accepts most types of paints, texture and
wall covering materials. The surface shall
be primed and sealed with a full-bodied
latex primer before applying a final
decorative material. This will equalize the
suction between the joint compounds
and the paper surface.
For best painting results, all surfaces,
including joint compound, should be
clean, dust-free and not glossy. If glossy
paints are used, a thin skim coat of
compound over the entire surface, Level
5 finish, is recommended to reduce
highlighting or joint photographing. This
method is also recommended for areas
of critical sidelighting of natural or
artificial light sources.
A sealer application under wallpaper or
other wall covering is also recommended
so the board surface will not be damaged
if the covering is subsequently removed
during redecorating. Joint treatment must
be thoroughly dry before proceeding with
primer-sealer application and final
decoration.

FIRE RESISTANT RATINGS
Fire resistance ratings represent
the results of tests on
assemblies made up of
specific materials in a specific
configuration. When selecting
construction designs to
meet certain fire resistance
requirements, caution must
be used to insure that each
component of the assembly is
the one specified in the test.
Further, precaution should be
taken that assembly procedures
are in accordance with those
of the tested assembly. (For
copies of specific tests, call
1-800-NATIONAL.)

INSTALLATION
RECOMMENDATIONS
Installation of Fire-Shield Gypsum
Board should be consistent
with the methods described in
the standards and references
noted.
GRIDMARX®
Fire-Shield Gypsum Board comes
standard with GridMarX®
guide marks, printed on the
paper surface. These guide
marks align with standard
building dimensions and help
to quickly identify fastener
lines for stud and joist framing.
Using GridMarX, accurate cuts
can be made without having
to draw lines. The use of
GridMarX also provides quick
identification and uniform nail/
screw patterns.
GridMarX guide marks run the
machine direction of the board
at five points in 4" increments.
Marks run along the edge in
both tapers and at 16", 24" and
32" in the field of the board.
The marks cover easily with no
bleed-through using standard
paint products.
Vertical Application - In a vertical
application, GridMarX serve as
a guide mark to help identify
the exact location of framing
members behind the gypsum
board eliminating the need for
field applied vertical lines.
Horizontal Application - In
a horizontal application,
GridMarX serve as a reference
mark to help identify the
location of framing members
behind the gypsum board. (If
framing member is located 2"
to the right of the GridMarX at
the top edge of the board, it
will be located 2" to the right
down the face of the board)
DECORATION
For best painting results, all
surfaces, including joint
compound, should be clean,
dust-free and not glossy. To
improve fastener and joint
concealment, a coat of a
quality primer is recommended
to equalize the porosities
between surface paper and
joint compound.
The selection of a paint to
give the specified or desired
finished characteristics is the
responsibility of the architect or
contractor.
Fire-Shield Gypsum Board that is
to have a wallcovering applied
to it should be prepared
and primed as described for
painting.
Gypsum Association GA-214,
Recommended Specification
for Levels of Gypsum Board
Finish, should be referred to in
order to determine the level
of finishing needed to assure
a surface properly prepared to
accept the desired decoration.
