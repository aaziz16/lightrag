PRODUCT DATA SHEET
Specseal Il
SERIES LC ENDOTHERMIC SEALANT
APPLICATIONS
SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant is designed primarily
for sealing construction joints and gaps as well as
penetrations for noncombustible penetrants. SpecSeal
Series LC has been tested and approved for single
metallic pipe penetrations up to 24" (610 mm) as well
as multiple penetrants through both masonry and
gypsum wallboard constructions. Additional systems
have been tested for steel sleeved penetrations as well
as some common electrical and communications cable
penetrations and joint penetrations. See STI's Product
& Application Guide as well as the UL Fire Resistance
Directory for complete listings.
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant is a latex-based, high solids firestop compound. This material, when
properly installed, will effectively seal penetration openings and joints against the spread of fire,
smoke, toxic gasses and water.
SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant is engineered to adhere well to virtually all construction surfaces and
may be applied using a standard caulk gun or by troweling with a standard mason's trowel or with
a putty knife.
SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant dries without shrinking to form a flexible shield against the propagation
of fire. Its premium latex binder system is totally resistant to water and will not re-emulsify after
drying. SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant is non-halogenated, contains no asbestos, inorganic fibers
or solvents.

SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant is the basis for systems that meet the exacting criteria of ASTM E1966 (UL2079) as well as the time-temperature requirements
of ASTM E119. Tested systems will provide up to a 3 hour rating utilizing as little as 1/4" (6 mm) of sealant depth (1/2" (13 mm) for 4 hours).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
GENERAL: Areas to be protected must be clean and free of oil, loose dirt, rust or scale. Installation temperatures must be between 35ºF (2°C) and 100°F
(38℃). Allow product to dry a minimum of 24 hours before exposure to moisture.
SYSTEM SELECTION: Consult UL® Fire Resistance Directory, STI Product & Application Guide, or drawings provided by the manufacturer for specific details
concerning installation design and requirements.
FORMING: Some installations may require forming as either an integral part of the system or as an option to facilitate installation. In systems where forming is
required, mineral wool batting (3" (76 mm) nom. thickness, min. 4 lb./cu. ft. 64 kg/m3 density) is recommended. Mineral wool is to be highly compressed and
friction fitted into the opening. Position forming or packing material to allow for the proper depth of fill material.
INSTALLATION OF FILL MATERIAL: SpecSeal® Series LC sealant may be installed by caulking using a standard caulking gun or from bulk containers using a
bulk loading caulk gun, or by manually troweling using a mason's trowel or putty knife. If the sealant tends to pull back from a surface, clean the surface with a
damp rag or sponge and reapply. Install sealant to required depth. Work sealant into all areas exercising care to eliminate voids or seams. The surface of the
sealant can be smoothed using a putty knife dipped in water. Adding water to the sealant itself is not recommended. Sealant (when dry) may be sanded and
painted using most non-solvent based paints. In gypsum wallboard penetrations, crown sealant a minimum of 1/4" (6 mm) from penetrant to wallboard surface
at a point approx. 1/2" (13 mm) or more from opening.
COVER PLATE: In some designs a galvanized steel cover plate (28 gauge) may be used to upgrade the fire resistance rating to 4 hours. Consult STI Product
and Application Guide for dimensional and fastening requirements.
LIMITATIONS: SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant is water-based and cures through the evaporation of water. Low temperatures as well as high humidity may retard
drying. Non-porous or impermeable backing materials, plates or coatings may retard the drying process. Do not paint or seal in any way that prevents contact
with air until sealant has dried through completely.
MAINTENANCE
Inspection: Installations should be inspected periodically for subsequent damage. Any damage should be repaired using SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant as per
the original approved design. Retrofit: When adding or removing penetrants, care should be taken to minimize damage to the seal. Reseal using SpecSeal®
Series LC Sealant as per the approved design. NOTE: New penetrants of a different nature than the original design may require a totally new firestop design or
extensive modifications to the existing design. Reseal openings as per the requirements of the modified design.
TECHNICAL SERVICE
Specified Technologies Inc. provides toll free technical support to assist in product selection and appropriate installation design. UL Systems, Material Safety
Data Sheets and other technical information is available at the Technical Library at www.stifirestop.com.
PRECAUTIONARY INFORMATION
Consult Material Safety Data Sheet for additional information on the safe handling and disposal of this material. Wash areas of skin contact with soap and
water. Avoid contact with eyes. The use of an OSHA or NIOSH approved mask for dust and mist environment is recommended. Apply in areas with ade-
quate ventilation.
CAUTION: COATING IS CONDUCTIVE UNTIL DRY. DO NOT APPLY TO OR IN THE PRESENCE OF ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS.

SpecSeal® Series LC Sealant is available from authorized distributors worldwide. Consult factory for names and locations of the nearest sales representa-
tives or distributors.
